## **About Me**

I am 35 years old and a seasoned lawyer with over 13 years of professional experience. Most of my career has been spent as a public servant, where I have honed the following skills:

- Effective communication with a diverse range of people
- Resilience under stress
- Proficient time management
- A proactive approach to finding necessary information and solutions to complex problems

Handling large volumes of ever-changing information has instilled in me a passion for continuous learning.

> "Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young. The greatest thing in life is to keep your mind young." â€” Henry Ford.
